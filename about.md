title: About me
---

Hello. My name is zer0main. But in real life I'm known as
Pavel Dolgov. I love programming, computer science and
cryptography. For me there's nothing like watching the
Code coming alive.

I know these programming languages: C, C++, Python, Lua,
Shell (Bash and Batch). I'm learning Haskell and C++ now.
I do some Linux administration as well (I'm an advanced Linux
user).
I'm studying in The Moscow School of Programming in
Yandex.

My goal is to write The Perfect Code.
