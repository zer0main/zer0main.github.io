Hello. My name is zer0main, in real life I am known as
Pavel Dolgov. I love programming, computer science and
cryptography. For me there is nothing like watching the
Code coming alive.

I know these programming languages: C, C++, Python, Lua,
Go, Haskell. I am an advanced Linux user.
I graduated from [The Moscow School of Programming (Yandex branch)][mshp-link].

My goal is to write The Perfect Code.
